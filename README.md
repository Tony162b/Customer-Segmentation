# Customer-Segmentation


In this project, the mall owners have noticed stagnation in sales and profit and to resolve this and increase profit. They decided to consult with a data scientist to use ML and AI to help segment their customers to help strategize sales.

I will be performing customer segmentation with AI and ML to promote sales and increase profit. I will be using K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to group the customers into the most profitable segments that will make it easy to target.

K-Means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that divides the given data into the given number of clusters. Here, the “K” is the given number of predefined groups that we need to create.

K-Means is straightforward to implement. It is highly scalable can be applied to both small and large datasets. There is, however, a problem with choosing the number of clusters or K. Also, with the increase in dimensions, stability decreases. But overall, K Means is a simple and robust algorithm that makes clustering very easy.
