Introduction

A shopping Mall experiencing some decline and stagnation in some areas of product sales and profit is seeking ways to revamp the product sales and increase profit. To make this happen, the company is seeking to use AI and Machine learning to segment its customers base to enable them to be more efficient in terms of time, money, and other resources.

Objective 

The goal of this project is to:
1.	Perform an exploratory analysis on the dataset.
2.	Check that the assumptions K-means makes are fulfilled.
3.	Apply K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers
